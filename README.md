# Dynamic-Traffic-and-Emission-Management
Dynamic Traffic and Emission Management (DTEM), implements an intelligent system to actively optimize urban traffic flow, directly resulting in reduced vehicular emissions and fuel consumption.
Key FeaturesAdaptive Signal Control: Utilizes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent trained on traffic simulation data (e.g., SUMO) to dynamically adjust traffic light timings in real-time. This minimizes average vehicle delay and the frequency of stop-and-go events.Predictive Congestion Modeling: Integrates real-time data from simulated $\text{IoT}$ sensors (e.g., virtual loop detectors) to forecast short-term congestion, allowing the RL agent to proactively optimize flow.Emission Quantification: Calculates and reports real-time network-wide emissions ($\text{CO}_2$, $\text{NO}_\text{x}$) based on vehicle speed, acceleration profiles, and a standard emission model (e.g., HBEFA or a custom model).Performance Metrics: Focuses on minimizing key performance indicators (KPIs) like Total Travel Time (TTT), Queue Length, and Total Emissions.
Technologies Used-Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility), and data visualization libraries.
Goal: To demonstrate a scalable, cost-effective solution for creating greener, more efficient urban mobility networks.
